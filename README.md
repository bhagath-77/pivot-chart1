Nutritional Data Analysis with Pivot Charts
Welcome to the Nutritional Data Analysis with Pivot Charts project! This repository contains a comprehensive dataset and analysis of various food items, focusing on their nutritional content. Whether you're a health enthusiast, a data analyst, or someone interested in nutrition, this project provides valuable insights into the nutritional profiles of over 200 food items.

üìä Project Overview
This project is centered around a detailed Excel file that contains nutritional data for a wide range of foods, including desserts, beverages, nuts, seeds, dairy products, and more. The dataset includes metrics such as caloric value, macronutrients (fat, protein, carbohydrates), vitamins, minerals, and other nutritional components.

The Excel file is organized into multiple sheets, including:
Raw Data: The main dataset with nutritional information for each food item.
Pivot Tables: Summarized data for key metrics like maximum caloric value, average protein content, and sum of specific vitamins.
Dashboards: Visual representations of the data for easy analysis and comparison.

üéØ Key Features
Comprehensive Dataset: Over 200 food items with detailed nutritional information.
Nutritional Metrics: Includes caloric value, fat, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins (A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, C, D, E, K), and minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, etc.).
Pivot Tables & Charts: Summarized data and visualizations for quick insights.
Easy to Use: The Excel file is well-organized, making it simple to navigate and analyze the data.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Project
Download the Excel File: The main file, pivot_chart_project_2.xls, contains all the data and analysis.
Explore the Sheets:
Raw Data: View the complete dataset with all nutritional metrics.
Pivot Tables: Analyze summarized data for specific metrics like caloric value, protein, and vitamins.
